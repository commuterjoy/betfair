BETFAIR API
===========

------------
Installation
------------

Betfair is available through [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/betfair) and can be installed via:

gem install betfair OR with bundler: gem 'betfair' and `bundle install`

------------
Introduction
------------
irb

require 'betfair'

or from a Gemfile

gem 'betfair'

# create a client for the General API so that you can log in.
bf = Betfair::API.new({:username => 'username', :password => 'password'})

If you want to use a proxy or turn on Savon's logging then just pass in like so:

proxy = '	http://localhost:8888' # This is a local squid proxy I tunnel to from my local machine to access the host server in UK for dev purposes.
logging = true
bf = Betfair::API.new({:proxy => proxy, :logging => true, :username => 'username', :password => 'password'})

Proxy's can be useful if you want to host on a cloud service such as Heroku, as you will be denied access to the Betfair API from the USA. 

Just proxy via a server from a country that Betfair allow's, such as the UK.
