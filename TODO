Sessions
--------

- DONE Create a secure(ish) way of generating a session_token (read a username from chmod 400 base64'd file)
- Implement session tokens as described in the API (to allow for long-running processes etc.)
    - DONE refactor sessions out of all the method calls
    - DONE on receiving any api response replace the existing session token with the new one
    - allow many processes to share a single token (persist session_token to a file)
    
General
-------

- Write simple models to represent the responses - markets, prices etc.
- Write a commander command-line tool for all operations
- DONE Move helpers to different class
- A system to throttle the API so that many running processes off the same account don't breach the API rate limits.
