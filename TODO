Sessions
--------

- Create a secure(ish) way of generating a session_token (probably read username from chmod 400 base64'd file)
- Implement session tokens as described in the API (to allow for long-running processes etc.)
    - DONE refactor sessions out of all the method calls
    - on receiving any api response replace the existing session token with the new one
    - allow many processes to share a single token
    
General
-------

- Write simple models to represent the responses - markets, prices etc.
- Write a commander command-line tool for all operations
- Move helpers to different class

Tests
-----

- DONE Remove all external dependencies on the unit tests
